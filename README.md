# Learning
A place for my learning projects

Right now I will be mostly making Unity games using C#, and various tutorials and some assets from around the internet + my own imagination.
I will also try to learn some basic modeling in Blender, and try to apply it to my game. Like breaking rocks And some physics.

I'm finishing up Brackeys Series on Survival Games, which helps me a lot to keep my mind focused on tasks one by one.
It's a 5 year old course, and was made on Unity 4 and in Javascript, which works really well since I have to write everything on my own in C#, 
while learning useful concepts that are universal about Unity and it's language specifics.

Any way, have fun trying the game out!


There will be a dev_build soon, and also all the code and assets used/that will be used.

There is not much to do in the game right now.
